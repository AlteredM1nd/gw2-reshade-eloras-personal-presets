## FOV & Camera Tips

- **Field of View (FOV):** For screenshots, I recommend zooming all the way in (first-person style) for the most cinematic effect. However, feel free to adjust FOV to your preference for gameplay or wider shots.
- **Camera Position:** Experiment with camera angles and zoom for the best composition.

---

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q: The preset looks wrong or some effects are missing!**
- Double-check that all required .fx files are present.
- Make sure your in-game graphics settings match the recommendations.
- Try reloading the preset in the ReShade menu.

**Q: My game is running slowly!**
- Some effects (like MXAO, SSDO, and high-quality DOF) are demanding. Disable or lower their quality in the ReShade menu if needed.

**Q: Where do I get missing shaders?**
- Most are included with the standard ReShade install. For third-party shaders, check the [ReShade forums](https://reshade.me/forum/) or the shader author's GitHub.
