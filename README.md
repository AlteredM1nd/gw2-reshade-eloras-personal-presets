## About This Preset

This preset is designed for high-quality screenshots and immersive exploration in Guild Wars 2. It enhances lighting, contrast, bloom, and ambient occlusion for a cinematic look. The First Person Photos and Third Person Photos presets are designed for taking screenshots using the specified perspectives, the main difference between them being the hyperfocal distance setting in the ADOF.fx filter. I'll be working on developing an additional set of presets that are less intensive and can be used for general gameplay, when those are completed I'll merge those into the main branch, create a new release, and update the changelog. Stay tuned!

## FOV & Camera Tips

- **Field of View (FOV):** For screenshots, I recommend zooming all the way in (first-person style) for the most cinematic effect. However, feel free to adjust FOV to your preference for gameplay or wider shots.
- **Camera Position:** Experiment with camera angles and zoom for the best composition.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q: The preset looks wrong or some effects are missing!**
- Double-check that all required .fx files are present.
- Make sure your in-game graphics settings match the recommendations.
- Try reloading the preset in the ReShade menu.

**Q: My game is running slowly!**
- Some effects (like MXAO, SSDO, and high-quality DOF) are demanding. Disable or lower their quality in the ReShade menu if needed.

**Q: Where do I get missing shaders?**
- Most are included with the standard ReShade install. For third-party shaders, check the [ReShade forums](https://reshade.me/forum/) or the shader author's GitHub.
